      <title>High Dimensional Data</title>

      <description>High dimensional data occurs when there is more predictors / features than number of observations. The majority of datasets coming out of modern biological techniques are high-dimensional.
Examples of high dimensional data Predict risk of diabetes on the basis of DNA sequence data Identify regions of interest associated with brain activation during a memory task …  This brings out statistical challenges. Too many predictors will overfit the data ( overfitting occurs when a regression model is tailored to fit a particular set of data but fails to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably).</description>

      <title>A facebook project: gail score model</title>

      <description>A while ago, I worked on a data science project that required me to collect data from Facebook. The goal was to estimate risk of breast cancer in women who had commented on various Facebook breast cancer support groups.
Background: Gail Score Model In order to estimate the risk of breast cancer, a health care provider looks at how many risk factors a woman has, many of them increase risk at different degrees.</description>

      <title>Quick tutorial on ggplot2</title>

      <description>ggplot2 has been my most used graphical tool for all of my data analysis projects. So, I thought my first blog post would be a short tutorial on how to use it to create meaningful plots.
ggplot2 ggplot2 is such a powerful R package for visualization. I personally admire the clarity and aesthetic of plots generated by this tool. It was created by Hadley Wickham in 2005 and is one of the best maintained R packages.</description>

      <description>Erlich administers the Hacker Hostel, a tech incubator where Richard, Big Head, Dinesh, and Gilfoyle live and work in exchange for 10 percent of their potential businesses. Erlich clings to his glory days, when he sold aviation start-up Aviato, a move that, at least in his mind, qualifies him to be a svengali lording over other tech nerds. He still drives a car emblazoned with multiple Aviato logos and smokes copious amounts of weed.</description>
